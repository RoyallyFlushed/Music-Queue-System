**Music Queue System**

This ended up being a reasonably larger project than expected as it was originally just a handy dump for a basic music system.
After a request to introduce more functionality into it, the program exploded and so did the efficiency of the code.

*Commands*

- :play *Song ID*   --// Plays the desired song
- :skip             --// skips the current song
- :repeat           --// Sets the playlist on a loop forever (Note: *:Skip* works but *:Play* doesn't)
- :normalise        --// 'unrepeats' the playlist (Note: dumps the remaining songs back into the queue)
